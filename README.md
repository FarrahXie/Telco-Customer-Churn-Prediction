**Project description**

Churn rate is a term that refers to the number of individuals or items leaving a collective group over a specified time period. Understanding the reason behind churn rate enables companies to understand why customers churn, and to prevent factors resulting in churn; it also allows companies to predict if a customer will churn, and develop strategies to prevent likely customer churn. Customer retention is critical to a business's success in competitive industries.

We're curious why customers leave or remain in a particular service. In this project, we explored the factors affecting churn rate, and designed methods to predict possibility of churn. The results can be used by companies to develop strategies for reducing customer churn.
